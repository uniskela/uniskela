# Env check — Cloud agent vs local workspace

## When to use

Run early in a session (or when continuity / credentials / browser tests / local CLIs matter) to classify the host. Use the result as **supporting context**. The Hub continuity fallback is triggered when **ADHD Hub MCP is missing, errored, unauthorized, or otherwise unavailable** — not merely because the runtime looks like a cloud sandbox.

## Quick detect

From a checkout that includes this skill:

```bash
bash skills/env-check/scripts/check_runtime.sh
```

Or after `npx skills add ./skills -g` / `uniskela/adhd-hub`, run the installed copy of `scripts/check_runtime.sh`.

Output lines:

- `RUNTIME_ENV: CLOUD_AGENT` or `RUNTIME_ENV: LOCAL_WORKSPACE`
- `RUNTIME_SIGNALS: …` (container / Cursor markers; informational)
- `HUB_CONTINUITY_TRIGGER: MCP unavailable …`
- `LOCAL_SKILL_CLIS: …` (CLOUD_AGENT: do not assume; LOCAL_WORKSPACE: may be available)

### Detection quality

The script **does not** treat `$USER=root` as cloud by itself (false positives on local root shells). It combines:

- Cursor Cloud markers: `CURSOR_AGENT`, `__CURSOR_SANDBOX_ENV_RESTORE`, `/tmp/cursor/cloud-agent-transcripts`, `/exec-daemon`, plus agent sockets when paired with container cues
- Container cues (`/.dockerenv`, cgroup) as **supporting** signals only — local Docker alone stays `LOCAL_WORKSPACE`

Do not invent “I'm in cloud” from a single weak hint. Prefer the script output when unsure.

## CLOUD_AGENT guidelines

When `RUNTIME_ENV: CLOUD_AGENT` (Cursor Cloud / remote sandbox):

- **Do not assume** machine-installed local skill binaries or CLIs exist (examples: `graphify`, other opt-in companions installed on a developer laptop). Cloud/remote sandboxes often cannot see those tools even when project rules mention them.
- If a required local CLI is missing: one-line notice, then continue via repo tools (Read/Grep/Glob/tests) and any **committed** artifacts such as `graphify-out/` when present. Never fabricate graphify graph output or Hub continuity/progress/thread state.
- No native browser GUI or macOS/Windows desktop binaries; prefer headless tests and CLI verification
- Prefer injected environment / OIDC / platform secrets over committing or relying on `.env.local`
- Local-only assumptions (opening `localhost` GUIs, host Docker socket from the agent VM, Tailscale to a private Hub) may fail — plan accordingly
- If Hub MCP tools are missing/errored/unauthorized: on the first substantial Hub-worthy turn, the **first line** of the reply MUST say Hub MCP is not available, plus a short fix hint (MCP URL → this Hub's `/mcp`, `ADHD_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN`, restart the agent; skip/cancel Auth if it hangs until Hub OAuth is enabled). Never invent Hub state or claim a Hub write succeeded
- Fallback still applies when Hub MCP is down: when issue-write access exists and the identity is on Hub **Inbox authors**, open/update a forge/GitHub issue titled `[ADHD] …` with Goal / Focus / Next / Resume (or Now / Done / Next / Return). Optional labels `adhd-hub`, `project:<slug>`, `source:cursor` — skip labels if the token cannot set them. Recommended: append `Made with [ADHD Progress Hub](https://github.com/uniskela/adhd-hub)` under a non-imported heading (e.g. `## Attribution`). No secrets, private Hub URLs, internal hosts/IPs, absolute local paths, or transcripts

## LOCAL_WORKSPACE guidelines

When `RUNTIME_ENV: LOCAL_WORKSPACE` (including local Docker / localhost):

- Machine-installed local skill CLIs (e.g. `graphify`) **may** be available — use them when present; still do not invent output if a binary is missing
- Local Docker, localhost services, and host browsers are OK when the operator's machine provides them
- Prefer Hub MCP (`resolve_project`, `session_digest`, `upsert_progress`, …) when it is reachable
- Same no-hallucination rule if MCP is down: acknowledge + fix hint; never invent Hub state; use the forge `[ADHD]` mailbox only when write access + Inbox authors allow it

## Continuity priority

1. **MCP unavailable?** → loud first-line warning + forge `[ADHD]` fallback (if allowed) — this is the Hub continuity trigger (still true on CLOUD_AGENT)
2. **Runtime env** → choose tests, credentials, tooling constraints, and whether local skill CLIs are expected
3. Prefer Hub MCP whenever it is available, on either runtime
