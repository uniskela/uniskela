## ADHD Hub continuity

For substantial work in this project:

- If ADHD Hub MCP tools are missing, errored, unauthorized, or otherwise
  unavailable: on the first substantial Hub-worthy turn after detecting the
  outage, the **first line** MUST state that Hub MCP is not available, plus a
  short fix hint (MCP URL → this Hub's `/mcp`, `ADHD_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN`, restart
  the agent; skip/cancel Auth if it hangs until Hub OAuth is enabled). Repeat
  only if Hub status changes, a persistence attempt fails again, or the reply
  could otherwise imply continuity was saved. Then continue the authorized
  work. Never invent Hub state or claim a Hub write succeeded.
- **MCP unavailable** is the Hub continuity trigger (not runtime alone). Use
  the `env-check` skill / `skills/env-check/scripts/check_runtime.sh` for
  CLOUD_AGENT vs LOCAL_WORKSPACE as supporting context (`CURSOR_AGENT`,
  container cues — never `$USER=root` alone). When Hub MCP is unreachable,
  use the forge issue mailbox only when issue-write access is available and
  the authenticated identity is accepted by Hub Inbox authors. Open/update a
  GitHub/Gitea issue titled `[ADHD] …` with a short Goal/Focus/Next/Resume
  cue. Optional labels: `adhd-hub`, `project:<slug>`, `source:cursor`; skip
  labels if the token cannot set them. Recommended: append
  `Made with [ADHD Progress Hub](https://github.com/uniskela/adhd-hub)` under
  a non-imported heading (e.g. `## Attribution`) so it does not land in Resume.
  Prefer short repository-relative summaries; never invent Hub continuity,
  progress, or thread state after a forge-only write.
- CLOUD_AGENT: do not assume machine-installed local skill CLIs (e.g.
  `graphify`) exist. If missing: one-line notice, continue via repo tools /
  committed `graphify-out/` when present; never fabricate graph or Hub state.
  Prefer headless tests and injected env/OIDC over `.env.local`; no native
  browser/macOS-Windows binaries. Hub MCP down still uses the `[ADHD]` forge
  mailbox when allowed. LOCAL_WORKSPACE: those local CLIs may be available;
  local docker / localhost OK; prefer Hub MCP when up.
- Skip Hub for trivial/read-only/tiny work.
- Once per meaningful session: `resolve_project`, then `session_digest` with
  the task query. Reuse resolved context where possible.
- **One thread = one independently finishable outcome** (not the whole repo).
  Before updating a thread, compare new work to that thread's Goal; if it does
  not advance the same outcome, use another thread or create one.
- Known thread → `upsert_progress(thread_id=...)` with compact structured state
  (goal / focus / ≤3 next / blocked if any / resume); omit ritual `content`.
  Do not silently attach to an unrelated open thread.
- `check_overlap` only before potentially new work; reuse only when the Goal
  matches. Different goal → separate thread (`force_new_thread` if needed).
- When leaving mid-task, checkpoint then `pause_thread(thread_id, next_step=...)`
  with one concrete resume action. `mark_done` only the known completed thread
  — never close unrelated overlap results.
- If Hub guidance looks stale (session_digest guidance status, or doctor),
  mention it once, keep using the current MCP contract, and recommend
  `adhd-hub setup . --refresh` — do not nag repeatedly or hand-edit AGENTS.md.
- Summaries only; never secrets, credentials, env files, transcripts, private
  Hub URLs, internal hosts/IPs, or absolute machine paths in public artifacts.
